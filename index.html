                                    However, if you're looking for a fullstack&nbsp;developer, I might be able to help you out. 
                                </p>

                                    I'm currently enrolled in a Fullstack certificate program at Georgia&nbsp;Tech. I studied advertising at the University of Georgia (yes, I'm aware there's a rivalry there) and worked in digital advertising for 4 years
                                    before making the switch over to programming. My experience in digital advertising means I already have great experience dicussing business in the digital space as well as working with a team to deliver assets in tight deadlines.

                                    For fun - I'm no Bobby&nbsp;Brown, but I'm not a bad singer and while I'm definitely not a botanist, I'm big into nature and exploring as much of it as I can. I love staying active, whether it's running, gym, hiking, or surfing. If you want to learn more, please contact me! I'd be happy to talk over the phone or over pizza.

                                    P.S. I'm also a fan of Portlandia, to which I dedicate my subtle background art choice. <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHmLljk2t8M">#putabirdonit</a>
